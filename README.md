# Particle Simulation System

A particle simulation system written in Haskell that allows you to interact with particles. You can drag particles and adjust the coefficients of restitution (elasticity) for both the particles and the walls.

## Features

- **Drag Particles**: Clikc and drag particles to move them around the simulation.
- **Adjust Coefficients of Restitution**: Change the elasticity of particles and walls to see how it affects the simulation.

## Requirements

- **Haskell**: Make sure you have GHC installed.
- **Stack or Cabal**: For managing dependencies and building the project.
